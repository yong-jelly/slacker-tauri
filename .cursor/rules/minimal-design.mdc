# Minimal macOS TODO App UI/UX Guideline

This document provides a systematic guideline for building a minimal, high-visibility, and calm macOS desktop TODO application. Optimize for speed, clarity, and "Figma vector" crispness.

## 1. Design Principles (macOS-First)
- **Hierarchy through Restraint**: Use white space and weight instead of borders and loud colors.
- **Predictable Affordance**: Elements should look like they behave. Follow macOS native patterns (toolbars, sidebars).
- **Keyboard-First**: Every primary action must be reachable via keyboard.
- **Calm Visibility**: Reduce visual noise. Only show actions on hover or selection where appropriate.
- **Forgiveness**: Support easy undo/redo and clear states for destructive actions.
- **Native Material**: Use macOS vibrancy (blur) for sidebars and toolbars to feel integrated with the OS.

## 2. Information Architecture + Layout
- **Structure**: 
  - **Sidebar**: Navigation (Lists, Filters like 'Today', 'Upcoming'). Width: 200pt–260pt.
  - **Main List**: The core workspace. Centered or left-aligned with generous margins.
  - **Inspector (Optional)**: Right-side pane for task details. Only shown when needed.
- **Grid & Spacing**: 8pt base grid. Use 4pt for tight internal spacing.
  - Default Padding: 16pt / 24pt for containers.
  - Compact Mode: Reduce vertical padding by 30%.

## 3. Typography (SF Pro)
- **Scale**:
  - **Title 1**: 20pt (Semibold) - View Headers
  - **Body**: 13pt (Regular) - Standard Task Text (macOS Default)
  - **Subheadline**: 11pt (Medium) - Metadata, Labels
  - **Caption**: 10pt (Regular) - Secondary timestamps
- **Rules**:
  - Line Height: 1.3–1.4x for readability.
  - Numeric Alignment: Use tabular numbers for dates and counts to prevent "jumping" during updates.
  - Weight over Size: Use `Medium` or `Semibold` to emphasize, rather than increasing font size.

## 4. Color + Materials
- **Palette**: Neutral-first (Grays) with **1 primary accent color** (e.g., macOS Blue or Brand Color).
- **Semantic Colors**:
  - Success: Green (Completion)
  - Warning: Orange (Due soon)
  - Destructive: Red (Overdue, Delete)
- **Contrast**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Materials**: 
  - Sidebar: `systemThinMaterial` (Vibrancy).
  - Main Area: `systemBackground` (Solid or slightly translucent).

## 5. Icons + "Figma Vector" Style
- **Style**: Consistent 1.5px stroke width. Use SF Symbols where possible or custom icons with matching geometry.
- **Tokens**:
  - Corner Radius: 4pt (Small elements), 8pt (Cards/Buttons), 12pt+ (Large containers).
  - Bounding Box: 16pt, 20pt, or 24pt. Center icons optically.
- **Don't**: Mix filled and outlined icons in the same context. Avoid odd angles.

## 6. Components & Interaction
- **Task Input**: Inline "Quick Add" at the top or bottom of the list. Support `Cmd+N`.
- **Task Row**: 
  - Left: Checkbox (Custom vector or native style).
  - Center: Title + Metadata (Tags, Date).
  - Right: Hidden actions (Edit, Delete) revealed on hover.
- **Context Menus**: Right-click on any task for full action set (Snooze, Move, Delete).

## 7. States & Feedback
- **Hover**: Subtle background change (e.g., `rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` in light mode).
- **Focus**: Native macOS focus ring or 2px accent border.
- **Motion**: Duration 120ms–180ms. Use "Ease-out" for entry, "Ease-in" for exit.
- **Validation**: Inline, non-intrusive. Avoid modal alerts for simple errors.

## 8. Accessibility + Keyboard
- **Navigation**: `Up/Down` to select, `Enter` to edit/complete, `Cmd+K` for Command Palette.
- **Hit Targets**: Minimum 24x24pt for icons, 44pt height for rows.
- **VoiceOver**: Ensure all icons have descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "Mark as complete").

## 9. Content Style (Microcopy)
- **Direct**: "Add Task" instead of "Click here to add a new item".
- **Verbs**: Use active verbs (Complete, Snooze, Archive).
- **Tense**: Consistent present tense.

## 10. Example Spec: "Task Row"
| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Height** | 44pt (Default), 32pt (Compact) |
| **Padding** | 12pt Horizontal, 8pt Vertical |
| **Checkbox** | 18x18pt, 4pt radius, 1.5px stroke |
| **Typography** | 13pt Regular (Title), 11pt Medium (Date) |
| **States** | **Hover**: Background `systemFill`. **Selected**: Accent Background. |
| **Interaction** | Single click to select, Double click to edit title. |

## Design Review Checklist
1. [ ] Does it use SF Pro with proper weights?
2. [ ] Are stroke widths consistent (1.5px)?
3. [ ] Is the 8pt grid followed?
4. [ ] Are primary actions reachable via keyboard?
5. [ ] Does it support both Light and Dark mode gracefully?
6. [ ] Is there enough white space to prevent cognitive load?
7. [ ] Are icons optically aligned with text?
8. [ ] Is the accent color used sparingly?
9. [ ] Do hover states provide immediate feedback?
10. [ ] Is the microcopy concise and verb-led?
11. [ ] Are hit targets large enough for easy clicking?
12. [ ] Does it feel like a native macOS app?
